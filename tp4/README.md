## TP 4 Notes


- In Exercise 1, we struggled with the texture coordinates in each figure. But using the [tangram-lines](images/tangram-lines.png) image, the task of figuring out the coordinates turned out to be easier than expected.
- To prove that the textures are placed correctly, we used an [image with flowers](images/tangram-flowers.png) in order to demonstrate the said correctness.

- In Exercise 2, we got confused as to where Texture Filtering was supposed to be placed as NEAREST, but eventually, we reched a solution, and this was the result (a minecraft block of grass with the correct definition).
